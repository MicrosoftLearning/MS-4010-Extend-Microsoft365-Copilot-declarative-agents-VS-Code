You're looking into building a solution for your organization to answer your colleagues' questions about IT policies. The solution must use authoritative information stored in the policies management system.

You did some research and found that building a declarative agent for Microsoft 365 Copilot, integrated with a Microsoft Graph connector is suitable for your needs, because:

- It allows you to build an AI-powered assistant that understands natural language.
- It allows you to build on top of the infrastructure of Microsoft 365 Copilot.
- It allows you to use instructions to optimize the assistant to your scenario.
- It allows you to connect the assistant to the policies management system so that it can answer authoritatively.

Previously, you and your colleagues from the IT department had to answer questions from within your organization, manually looking up the relevant policies. This was time-consuming and was distracting you from your work.

By building a declarative agent, you offer a specialized assistant that employees in your organization can use to get answers to their questions. By integrating the agent with a Graph connector, you connect it to the policy management system so that it can provide authoritative answers. Having such an assistant saves you and your colleagues in the IT time, allowing you to focus on more specialized tasks.
