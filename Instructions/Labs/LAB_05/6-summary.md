You're looking into building a solution for your car repair shop to let you and your colleagues easily look up information about the requested repairs using natural language.

You did some research and found that building a declarative agent for Microsoft 365 Copilot, integrated with an API plugin is suitable for your needs, because:

- It allows you to build an AI-powered assistant that understands natural language.
- It allows you to build on top of the infrastructure of Microsoft 365 Copilot.
- It allows you to use instructions to optimize the assistant to your scenario.
- It allows you to connect the assistant to the repairs management system so that it can answer authoritatively.

Previously, you and your colleagues had to manually lookup information in the repairs management system which was time-consuming and error prone.

By building a declarative agent, you offer a specialized assistant that you and your colleagues use to get answers to their questions. By integrating the agent with an API plugin, you connect it to the repairs management system so that it can provide authoritative answers. Having such an assistant saves you and your colleagues time, allowing you to focus on more specialized tasks.
