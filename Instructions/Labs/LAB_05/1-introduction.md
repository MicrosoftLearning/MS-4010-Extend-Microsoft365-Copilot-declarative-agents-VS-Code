# Introduction

Declarative agents for Microsoft 365 Copilot let you create AI-powered assistants optimized for specific scenarios. Using instructions, you define the context for the agent and configure its tone of voice or how it should respond. By integrating an agent with an API, you allow the agent to connect to external applications to retrieve data and perform actions.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work in a car repair shop. Your organization keeps track of the different repair requests using a specialized system. You and your colleagues regularly look up information about the different repairs. The current system offers a rudimentary search functionality that finds repairs only matching keywords. You would like to have an AI-powered assistant capable of answering questions about repairs, asked using natural language.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to integrate declarative agents with secured APIs. You'll understand how to securely connect a declarative agent to APIs secured with API keys and OAuth.
